# Big business and Docs-as-code

```{title} Daniel Woste personal page
```


Welcome dear friend ðŸ‘‹,

I'm Daniel, and I'm a passionate Software developer for topics round about 
* ðŸ“Š Business Insights
* ðŸ“š Smart Documentation and
* ðŸ”¨ Continuous Integration and ðŸ“¦ Delivery 

This is my private blog, used to write down my thoughts and ideas about documentation challenges in bigger teams.

I have developed a bunch of solutions, that make it possible to use the docs-as-code approach not only for end-user documentation but already during project setup and realization, including Application Lifecycle Management and the integration of external data from architecture and test frameworks.
Just take a look at [my projects](projects-target) for a quick overview.

My daily work is at [useblocks](https://useblocks.com), a small, specialized, German company creating tools for the international
Automotive industry. Focussing mostly on PMT (processes, methods, tools) for distributed software teams (>100-2.000 team members).
