# About me

With my company [useblocks](https://useblocks.com) I try to solve problems of big, distributed 
team structures with the help of smart software, simple processes and efficient tools.

**Groundwork**
^^^^^^^^^^
groundwork is a Python based microframework for highly reusable applications and their components.
Its functionality is based on exchangeable, well-documented and well-tested plugins and patterns.

Quite old and unmaintained. But I put some months into it, so it is worth beeing mentioned here :)
