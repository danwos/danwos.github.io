# Job advertisement for Sphinx-Needs

I just have detected the first job advertisement, which asks for [Sphinx-Needs](https://sphinx-needs.com)as skill. 
Yeah ðŸ¥³

The job is for a 
[Docs-As-Code Development engineer](https://www.bosch.de/karriere/job/REF113902H-docs-as-code-development-engineer)
at Bosch in Leonberg, Germany.

Sounds pretty cool. 

For the case Bosch takes the job advertisement offline, her a rough screenshot:
